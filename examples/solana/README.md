# Solana Golden Masters

This directory contains generated Anchor (Rust) programs for the Vegas example games.
These files serve as regression tests ("Golden Masters") for the Solana backend.

## Usage

To use one of these files in an Anchor project:

1.  Create a new Anchor project: `anchor init my_game`
2.  Replace `programs/my_game/src/lib.rs` with the content of one of these `.rs` files.
3.  Update `Anchor.toml` to match the program ID declared in the file (or update the file).
    *   Default placeholder ID: `Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS`
4.  Run `anchor build`.
5.  Run `anchor test`.

## Generation

These files are generated by running the Vegas CLI with the `--solana` flag:

```bash
java -jar vegas.jar examples/Simple.vg --solana
```
